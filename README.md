## Quick Notes

1. On iOS and on Android, if you change a system permission the app will restart. This means there is no need to observe AppState changing.
2. The Linking API has a URI scheme for opening the settings, this is the best (really the only) way to approve a pemission that was denied.
3. Make sure to change the permission message before submitting to the App Store. This will save you from a lot of heartache in the future, be very clear about what you want to do with said permission.
4. A lot of popular apps (like Google apps) have a modal that says "... Give us permissions ..." Before actually prompting a user. The reason for this is that if the user denies the permission in this fake modal, then you can always show it to them again later. If a user actually wants to use the permission they will approve two modals. But if they don't, you can try and make the permission usage more enticing.
